    <h1 class="display-4"><strong>Coffee Lover Project!</strong></h1>
  <p class="lead">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a
      coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.</p>

    <h1>Types of Coffee Drinks</h1>
<p>Latte, americano, affogato…it’s crazy all that you can do with a few small beans. Whether you’re a coffee newbie or you consider yourself a coffee connoisseur, there are so many types of coffee drinks to discover. Here are some of the most popular types ordered by coffee lovers nationwide.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Black</li>
<p>Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn’t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style.
</p>
        <li>Latte</li>
<p>As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here’s how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)
</p>
<li>Cappuccino</li>
<p>Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.
</p>
        <li>Americano</li>
<p>With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.
</p>
<li>Espresso</li>
<p>An espresso shot can be served solo or used as the foundation of most coffee drinks, like lattes and macchiatos.
</p>
        <li>Doppio</li>
<p>A double shot of espresso, the doppio is perfect for putting extra pep in your step.
</p>
<li>Cortado</li>
<p>Like yin and yang, a cortado is the perfect balance of espresso and warm steamed milk. The milk is used to cut back on the espresso’s acidity.
</p>
<li>Red Eye</li>
<p>Named after those pesky midnight flights, a red eye can cure any tiresome morning. A full cup of hot coffee with an espresso shot mixed in, this will definitely get your heart racing.
</p>
<li>Galão</li>
<p>Originating in Portugal, this hot coffee drink is closely related to the latte and cappuccino. Only difference is it contains about twice as much foamed milk, making it a lighter drink compared to the other two.
</p>
<li>Lungo</li>
<p>A lungo is a long-pull espresso. The longer the pull, the more caffeine there is and the more ounces you can enjoy.
</p>
<li>Macchiato</li>
<p>The macchiato is another espresso-based drink that has a small amount of foam on top. It’s the happy medium between a cappuccino and a doppio.
</p>
        <li>Mocha</li>
<p>For all you chocolate lovers out there, you’ll fall in love with a mocha (or maybe you already have). The mocha is a chocolate espresso drink with steamed milk and foam.
</p>
        <li>Ristretto</li>
<p>Ristretto is an espresso shot. It uses less hot water which creates a sweeter flavor compared to the bitter taste of a traditional shot of espresso or a doppio.
</p>
        <li>Flat White</li>
<p>This Aussie-born drink is basically a cappuccino without the foam or chocolate sprinkle. It’s an espresso drink with steamed milk.
</p>
<li>Affogato</li>
<p>The affogato is an excuse to enjoy a scoop of ice cream any time of day (and any time of year in my opinion). Served with a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso, or two. The affogato is extra delish served over a brownie.
</p>
<li>Café au Lait</li>
<p>Café au lait is perfect for the coffee minimalist who wants a bit more flavor. Just add a splash of warm milk to your coffee and you’re all set!
</p>
<li>Irish</li>
        <p>Irish coffee consists of black coffee, whiskey and sugar, topped with whipped cream. Here’s an Irish coffee recipe that will warm you right up.</h1><br></p>

            <h1>Types of Iced Coffee</h1>
            <p>What’s more refreshing than cool iced coffee in the summertime? Or maybe you enjoy these chilled drinks all year long. (We do!) Here are some of the best iced coffee drinks you can sip on.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Iced Coffee</li>
                <p>A coffee with ice, typically served with a dash of milk, cream or sweetener—iced coffee is really as simple as that.</p>
                <li>Iced Espresso</li>
                <p>Like an iced coffee, iced espresso can be served straight or with a dash of milk, cream or sweetener. You can also ice speciality espresso-based drinks like americanos, mochas, macchiatos, lattes and flat whites.</p>
                <li>Cold Brew</li>
                <p>The trendiest of the iced coffee bunch, cold brew coffees are made by steeping coffee beans from anywhere between 6-36 hours, depending on how strong you would like your cold brew. Once the beans are done steeping, add cold milk or cream. Here are a few of our best cold brew coffee tips.</p>
                <li>Frappuccino</li>
                <p>Made famous by Starbucks, the Frappuccino is a blended iced coffee drink that’s topped with whipped cream and syrup. But not all Frapps are made the same: watch out for coffee-free versions. Unless you’re into that sorta thing.</p>
                <li>Nitro</li>
                <p>A cold brew + nitrogen bubbles = a cold brew coffee with a frothy, Guinness-like consistency. (It’s poured via a nitro tap, too.)</p>
                <li>Mazagran</li>
                <p>Maza-who?! Mazagran coffee is a cross between iced coffee, tea and your favorite rum drink. It typically consists of espresso, lemon, sugar and (sometimes) rum.</p>

            <h1>Types of Coffee Makers</h1>
            <p>Now that you’re a master on all the coffee types, let’s learn how to make ’em! From French presses to Mokas, there are plenty of ways to prepare your dream cup of java.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>French Press</li>
                <p>This manual coffee maker is extremely easy to use. Add ground coffee beans into your French press, pour piping hot water over the grounds, let the coffee steep for a few minutes and finally, press the plunger down and pour! Simple as that. French presses can be used for any bean, but many people prefer using them for darker, richer roasts. Also, how fancy does this French press look? Make your morning brew…in style!</p>
                <li>Percolator</li>
                <p>Try out a percolator to add a retro feel to your daily brew—like 1880s retro. To put it simply, percolators brew coffee by continuously pushing boiling hot water bubbles up into the “coffee chamber” to steep the coffee grains. This cycle is repeated until the coffee is ready to serve. They’re typically used for medium roasts and prepared over the stovetop, but percolators can work over any heated surface, even a campfire (hint, hint!).</p>
                <li>Single Serve</li>
                <p>Single serve coffee maker sales have really peaked in the past few years. Measure out your desired coffee amount, pour into the reusable filter, pour water in and voila! A cup of coffee just for you will be ready soon. Single serve coffee makers are perfect for single-person households (or those where just one person drinks coffee). Try out this budget-friendly single serve coffee maker which includes a fun travel mug!</p>
                <li>AeroPress</li>
                <p>We’ve got another manual coffee maker for you. The AeroPress is very similar to the French press. To use an AeroPress, we recommend checking out this beautiful get-started guide. You can make espresso, lattes, cold brews or just a classic cup of coffee in this nifty little machine.</p>
                <li>Drip</li>
                <p>Aah, yes. The classic electric coffee maker you know and love. To get your brew going in a drip coffee maker, all you have to do is scoop your coffee, pour it into the filter, pour some water in and press start to let the drip coffee maker do it’s coffee magic. Soon, you’ll hear the sweet sounds of your coffee dripping right into your coffee pot. Mornings, conquered.</p>
                <li>Pour Over</li>
                <p>A pour-over coffee maker is exactly what it sounds like: you manually pour hot water over the beans. With a solid 5-star rating on Amazon, pour-over coffee makers like Chemex are a solid choice. Fans love the fact that you get to control the strength of the coffee, plus the pots are super easy to clean. You do need a special kind of filter, though, which is pricier than the typical drip coffee filter. However, some are reusable.</p>
                <li>Cold Brew</li>
                <p>Diehard cold brew fans may want to invest in a cold brew coffee maker. To use a cold brew maker, throw in your coffee grounds, brew and serve. You can store the coffee for up to 36 hours. If you’re looking for a multi-functional coffee maker, you can prepare cold brew coffees in other makers, like the AeroPress.</p>
                <li>Moka</li>
                <p>Moka pots share a lot of similarities with the percolator and there’s often confusion between the two. Both need a heated surface, like a stovetop or even a campfire. However, the Moka pot produces an espresso-like drink and its brewing process is a bit different than the percolator. You need to keep more of an eye on it because when the Moka pot’s water is spent, you should remove the pot from the heat surface to avoid burnt-tasting coffee. Whereas with the percolator’s simple brewing process, the longer you leave it running, the stronger the coffee will be.</p>
